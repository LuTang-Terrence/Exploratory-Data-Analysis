# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This is a project on EDA on white wine data set (project of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree). 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
1. Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
2. Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
3. Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
4. Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information

## Files

The project is written in R code as shown in the RMD file, and you can read the HTML [report](https://cdn.rawgit.com/LuTang-Terrence/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/33f847ad/White_Wine_EDA_Lu_Tang.html).
