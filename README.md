# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This is a practise project on EDA with R (in Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree). The project includes my thought and findings by exploring a set of white wine data. Based on the info text, there are a few objective tests with quantitative data, and a column of sensory variable (taste quality) as output. By univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses with summary and reflection in the following report, I hope to reveal some relationship between the inputs and “quality”. 

The original dataset can be found [here](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/).

The project is written in R code as shown in the RMD file, and you can read the [HTML](https://cdn.rawgit.com/LuTang-Terrence/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/33f847ad/White_Wine_EDA_Lu_Tang.html) file.
